kohAnimations
=============

Animation creation based on a sprite page

TODO list:

- adapt current code to an object (top priority)
- create API / edit wiki (top priority)
- set start and end different to (0,0) and (totalWidth,totalHeight)
- create different tipes of loop (currently, only default - 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4...) (ex: 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 3 2 1...)
- create blending (fading from img1 to img2)
- create tool to unify different sprites (img1, img2, img3...) into an sprite page
- create tool "animation editor" -> long term
- set different clipping region (oval, circle, star. blob-shaped...)
- think about more features / QOL elements
