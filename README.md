kohAnimations
=============

Animation creation based on a sprite page

TODO list:

- adapt current code to an object (top priority)
- create API / edit wiki (top priority)
- set start and end different to (0,0) and (totalWidth,totalHeight)
- create different tipes of loop (currently, only default - 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4...)
- create blending
- create tool to unify different sprites (img1, img2, img3...) into an sprite page (maybe caranthol??...)
- create tool "animation editor" -> long term
- think about more features / QOL elements
